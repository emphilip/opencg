# Ingestion

## Purpose

Ingest external knowledge through shared CLI and HTTP connector implementations with observable run status.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Connector framework

The ingestion service SHALL continue to expose connectors through both a CLI binary AND an HTTP surface as established by prior changes. This change MODIFIES the file-discovery and chunking layer used by every connector: discovery delegates to `graphify.collect_files(target_path)`, and chunking is **type-aware** — code files use symbol-level chunking via `graphify.extract([path])`, non-code files use the existing paragraph chunker.

The connector framework MUST NOT bypass either path. Every newly-ingested file MUST be dispatched by extension (or by an explicit `force_text` override on the connector configuration) to exactly one of the two chunkers.

#### Scenario: Code file is dispatched to symbol chunker

- **WHEN** the git connector processes a file whose extension is in the graphifyy code-extensions set (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
- **THEN** chunking calls `chunk_code_by_symbols(path, body)` which invokes graphifyy's extractor
- **AND** one chunk is produced per symbol (class, function, method)

#### Scenario: Markdown file is dispatched to paragraph chunker

- **WHEN** the git connector processes a `.md` file
- **THEN** chunking calls the existing `chunk_text(body)` paragraph chunker
- **AND** graphifyy's extractor is not invoked

### Requirement: Git connector

The git connector SHALL clone the repo, derive stable entity IDs from `(tenant, source_uri)`, compute content hashes, and emit `GitDocument`s.

File discovery MUST use `graphify.collect_files(repo_path)` and honour `.graphifyignore`. Code files MUST use symbol-aware graphifyy chunking; non-code files MUST use the paragraph chunker. Per-file discovery or parse failures MUST log a structured warning and allow the ingest to continue.

The git connector's per-chunk pipeline SHALL gain a final step that calls `extract_for_chunk` after the chunk's vector is upserted into Qdrant. The extraction step MUST run synchronously in the same chunk loop and MUST be wrapped in try/except so a single failure does not abort the ingest.

The connector MUST NOT block on extraction longer than the configured `extraction.timeout_seconds` (default 30). Exceeding the timeout cancels the extractor call, logs the timeout, and proceeds to the next chunk.

#### Scenario: Discovery uses graphifyy's language-aware filter

- **WHEN** the git connector ingests a repo that contains `.kt` (Kotlin) and `.swift` files
- **THEN** the Kotlin and Swift files appear in the document stream
- **AND** the connector code contains no extension allow-list

#### Scenario: `.graphifyignore` is respected

- **WHEN** the cloned repo contains a `.graphifyignore` file listing `vendor/`
- **THEN** files under `vendor/` are not yielded by the connector

#### Scenario: Per-file parse failure does not abort the ingest

- **WHEN** graphifyy's discovery or extraction raises on a single corrupted file
- **THEN** the connector logs a structured warning naming the path
- **AND** the surrounding files in the same repo are still ingested

#### Scenario: Extraction runs after vector upsert

- **WHEN** the git connector processes a chunk that produces an embedding successfully
- **THEN** the embedding is upserted to Qdrant
- **AND** `extract_for_chunk` is then called for the same chunk

#### Scenario: Extraction timeout does not stop the ingest

- **WHEN** the chat model hangs and the extractor times out on chunk N
- **THEN** chunk N's catalog row and Qdrant point remain in place
- **AND** the connector continues to chunk N+1
- **AND** a structured warning is logged naming the chunk's `entity_id`

### Requirement: Ingestion HTTP surface

The ingestion service SHALL expose the following HTTP endpoints on port `8100`:

- `GET /healthz` - liveness, returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
- `GET /readyz` - readiness; returns `200` once the underlying storage (Postgres + Qdrant + Ollama embeddings) is reachable.
- `GET /connectors` - returns a JSON array of `{name, supported, reason?}` entries. `git` MUST have `supported = true`. `confluence`, `custom-api`, and `web` MUST have `supported = false` with a `reason` naming the change that will implement them.
- `POST /run/git` - body `{"repo_url": <string>}`. MUST return `{run_id, status}` immediately and execute the git ingest in a background task using the same `pipeline_runner.run` code path as the CLI.
- `GET /runs/recent` - returns the most recent 100 runs as `[{run_id, connector, repo, started_at, finished_at, status, parents, chunks, error}]`, in-memory.

Run history MAY be in-memory only. Durability across container restarts is deferred to a follow-up change.

#### Scenario: Health endpoints

- **WHEN** the ingestion service is up
- **THEN** `GET /healthz` returns `200` with `{"status":"ok"}`
- **AND** `GET /readyz` returns `200` only when the storage backends are reachable

#### Scenario: Connectors enumeration

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /connectors`
- **THEN** the response contains `git` with `supported = true`
- **AND** the response contains `confluence`, `custom-api`, and `web` with `supported = false` and a `reason` field

#### Scenario: Run lifecycle observable via /runs/recent

- **WHEN** a `POST /run/git` triggers a background run that eventually succeeds
- **THEN** `GET /runs/recent` shows the run progressing through `queued → running → succeeded`
- **AND** the final entry carries the populated `parents` and `chunks` counts

#### Scenario: Run failure surfaces error

- **WHEN** a `POST /run/git` triggers a background run that fails (e.g. unreachable repo)
- **THEN** the `/runs/recent` entry for that run reaches `status = failed`
- **AND** the entry carries a non-empty `error` string

### Requirement: Symbol-level code chunking

The ingestion service SHALL provide `chunk_code_by_symbols(path, source_text) -> list[Chunk]`. The function MUST:

1. Call `graphify.extract([path])` to obtain the file's symbol nodes.
2. For each node, extract the source-text span between the symbol's start and end lines.
3. Yield one `Chunk` per symbol, in document order, with chunk metadata including the symbol's stable id (`module.path.ClassName.method_name` shape), the symbol kind (`class` / `function` / `method`), and the start/end line numbers.

Edge handling:
- Symbols smaller than the configured `min_symbol_chars` (default 50) MUST be merged with adjacent symbols in the same scope, up to `target_chars` (default 2000).
- Symbols larger than the configured `max_symbol_chars` (default 8000) MUST be split by the paragraph chunker, with each sub-chunk carrying the parent symbol's id.
- Files that produce zero symbols (e.g., a config-heavy YAML script that ended up in the code path by extension) MUST fall back to the paragraph chunker for the whole file.

#### Scenario: One chunk per Python function

- **WHEN** the symbol chunker processes a Python file with three top-level functions
- **THEN** three chunks are yielded, each spanning exactly one function's source range

#### Scenario: Tiny adjacent symbols merge

- **WHEN** a class has five getter methods of less than 50 characters each
- **THEN** the chunker merges them into one or two chunks that stay under `target_chars`
- **AND** the merged chunk's metadata lists all included symbol ids

#### Scenario: Oversized symbol is paragraph-split

- **WHEN** a single function body exceeds 8000 characters
- **THEN** the chunker emits multiple chunks, each tagged with the parent symbol's id
- **AND** each sub-chunk stays at or under 2000 characters

#### Scenario: File with no symbols falls back

- **WHEN** the symbol chunker is invoked on a Python file that contains only top-level statements (no defs, no classes)
- **THEN** the paragraph chunker is invoked on the whole file body
- **AND** no symbol metadata is attached to the resulting chunks

### Requirement: Re-extract CLI subcommand

The `cortex-ingest` CLI SHALL gain a `re-extract` subcommand that walks every chunk in the catalog (filtered optionally by `--source` and `--since`) and runs `extract_for_chunk` against each. The subcommand SHALL be idempotent (skip chunks whose latest evidence row was written by the current or newer extractor version) and SHALL respect the same `extraction.timeout_seconds` and best-effort error handling as the connector hook.

#### Scenario: Re-extract uses latest version filtering

- **WHEN** the operator runs `cortex-ingest re-extract --source git` and the configured `extractor_version` is `v2`
- **THEN** chunks whose latest `relationship_evidence` row already has `extractor_version = "v2"` are skipped
- **AND** chunks with no evidence row OR an older version are re-extracted

#### Scenario: Re-extract is best-effort

- **WHEN** the chat model fails on a single chunk during re-extract
- **THEN** the CLI continues with the next chunk
- **AND** logs a summary at the end with succeeded / failed / skipped counts

### Requirement: Bounded Git ingestion

The Git ingestion CLI SHALL accept optional positive integer limits for maximum documents and maximum chunks. With neither limit supplied, ingestion MUST retain its existing unlimited behavior.

Document selection MUST follow deterministic connector discovery order. Once the document limit is reached, no additional parent entity may be inserted. Once the chunk limit is reached, no additional chunk entity may be inserted, embedded, vector-upserted, or graph-extracted. The CLI summary MUST report the applied limits and whether the run was truncated.

#### Scenario: Default ingestion remains unlimited

- **WHEN** the operator runs the Git ingestion CLI without document or chunk limits
- **THEN** every discovered document and chunk is processed according to the existing connector contract
- **AND** the summary does not report truncation

#### Scenario: Document limit stops new files

- **WHEN** the operator ingests a repository with `--max-documents 1`
- **THEN** exactly one parent document is processed
- **AND** no parent or chunk from a second document is inserted
- **AND** the summary reports document truncation

#### Scenario: Chunk limit stops all downstream work

- **WHEN** the operator ingests a repository with `--max-chunks 2`
- **THEN** at most two chunk entities are inserted
- **AND** at most two embedding, vector-upsert, and text-extraction operations occur
- **AND** the summary reports chunk truncation

#### Scenario: Invalid limits are rejected

- **WHEN** the operator supplies zero or a negative document or chunk limit
- **THEN** the CLI exits before cloning with a validation error naming the invalid option
